# LeafyLogs

## Description

This application merges the concept of a game and a journal. Users can take care of a virtual plant by watering and mulching it, while also noting down their thoughts on "leaves" which get stored and can be viewed later. The app tracks the user's interactions and adjusts the plant's health accordingly, offering a relaxing and engaging way to journal daily activities and thoughts.

## Features

- Plant Care: Users can care for a virtual plant by watering and mulching it. The hydration and nutrients levels of the plant decrease over time, and users need to keep them in check to keep the plant alive.
- Journal Entries: Users can write down their thoughts on virtual "leaves", which get stored and can be retrieved later.
- Disaster Event: Occasionally, a disaster event occurs, halving the hydration and nutrient levels of the plant, adding a little challenge to the game.
- Seasonal Themes: Users can change the theme of the app to match the season, enhancing the visual appeal of the app.
- Local Storage: All user interactions, including the last watered/mulched time, the plant's hydration and nutrient levels, and journal entries are stored in the local storage, maintaining the game's state between sessions.
